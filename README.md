# cv-project-skin-cancer-detection
A deep learning-based skin cancer detection system using ResNet50 and TensorFlow This project utilizes deep learning to detect skin cancer from dermoscopic images. It employs a fine-tuned ResNet50 model for binary classification, identifying whether a given image is benign or malignant.Project Summary

This project integrates a ResNet50 backbone with custom classification layers to build a robust and accurate skin cancer detector. It is trained on a binary-labeled dataset using TensorFlow's ImageDataGenerator and optimized using the Adam optimizer.

Features:
✅ Binary classification: benign vs malignant
✅ Transfer learning with ResNet50
✅ Custom classification layers
✅ Keras-based training and testing pipelines
✅ Accurate and scalable diagnostic tool
